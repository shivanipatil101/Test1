Badminton racket
Used to hit the shuttlecock over the net, rackets are made of a frame, handle, and strings. Modern rackets are often made of carbon fiber composite and have a square or oval head. 

Shuttlecock
Also called a birdie, the shuttlecock is a ball with 16 feathers attached to a cork base covered in leather. Modern shuttles often use plastic feathers instead of real ones.
